## How to Push your code to GitHub
To push your code to GitHub, follow these steps:

Initialize Git: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Use the git init command to initialize Git in that directory.

Add files to the staging area: Use the git add command to add the files you want to include in the commit. For example, to add all files, use git add ..

Commit changes: Create a commit to save the changes you've added to the staging area. Use the git commit command with a descriptive message to commit your changes. For example, git commit -m "Initial commit".

Create a GitHub repository: Go to GitHub (https://github.com) and sign in to your account. Click on the "+" sign in the top-right corner and select "New repository." Follow the prompts to create a new repository with a name, description, and any desired settings.

Add the remote repository: In your local Git repository, add the remote repository URL using the git remote add command. For example, git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git.

Push to GitHub: Finally, use the git push command to push your commits to the GitHub repository. Specify the remote repository and branch you want to push to, like git push origin master (assuming you're pushing to the "master" branch).

After executing the push command, Git will transfer your code to GitHub. You can then visit your GitHub repository and verify that the code has been successfully pushed.# website
